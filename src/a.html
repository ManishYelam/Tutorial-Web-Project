    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.</li>
       <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       HyperText is the method by which Internet users navigate the web. The use of hyper means it is not linear, so users can go anywhere on the Internet simply by clicking on the available links.
       A markup language is one that is designed for defining and presenting text. Within a text file such as an HTML file, elements are marked up using tags which explain the purpose of that part of the content

    <h3>HTML History</h3>
    <p>
       HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.

    <p>
       HTML Tags usually exist in pairs consisting of a starting and an ending tag. However, some tags do not have a closing tag. HTML Elements contain a starting tag, content, and an ending tag. If there is no content in an HTML Element, it is called an Empty HTML Element. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
       Empty HTML Elements: HTML Elements without any content i.e., that do not print anything are called Empty elements. Empty HTML elements do not have an ending tag. For instance.{`<br>, <hr>, <link>, <input>`} etc are HTML elements.
    </p>
 
    <h3>{`Attributes =>`}</h3>
    <p>
       {`
       Attributes always come in name/value pairs like this: attribute_name=”value”. 
       Attributes are always added to the start tag of an HTML element.
       Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotes. Double style quotes (“ ”) are the most common, but single style quotes (‘ ’) are also allowed.
       In some rare situations, like when the attribute value itself contains quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes: name=’The person “ABC” is very good’ and vice-versa.
       <element attribute_name="attribute_value">`
       }
    </p>
 
    <h3>{`HTML src Attribute =>`}</h3>
    <p>
       {`
       If we want to insert an image into a webpage, then we need to use the <img> tag and the src attribute.
       <img src="">
       HTML alt Attribute: This is an alternate tag that is used to show or display something if the primary attribute i.e., the <img> tag, fails to display the value assigned to it. This can also be used to describe the image to a developer who is actually sitting at the coding end.`
       }
    </p>
 
    <h3>{`HTML href Attribute=>`}</h3>
    <p>
       This attribute is used to specify a link to any address. This attribute is used along with the <pre>{`<a>`}</pre> tag. The link put inside the href attribute gets linked to the text displayed inside the<a> tag.
      <pre>{` <a href="">`}</pre>
    
       {/* <img src="" alt="" /> */}
       <ul>
          <li>The <pre>{`<!DOCTYPE html>`}</pre>declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
          HTML 4.01:
          <pre>{`<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">`}</pre>
          </li>
          <li>The <pre>{`<html>`}</pre> element is the root element of an HTML page. All other elements are contained within it.</li>
          <li>The  <pre>{`<head>`}</pre> element contains meta information about the HTML page. The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren’t visible on the front-end of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <pre>{`<title>`}</pre> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)</li>
          <li>The <pre>{`<body>`}</pre> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</li>
       </ul>
 
       {/* <img src="" alt="" /> */}
       <ul>
          <li>The lang attribute specifies the language of the element's content. Common examples are "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French and so on.</li>
       </ul>
       
       {/* <img src="" alt="" /> */}
       <ul>
          <li>HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!</li>
          <li>UTF(Unicode Transformation Format)</li>
       </ul>
       
       {/* <img src="" alt="" /> */}
       <ul>
          <li>The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.</li>
          <li>The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen- width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).</li>
          <li>The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.</li>
